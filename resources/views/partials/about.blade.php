                <h3> In the beginning </h3>
                <p>Hi, I am Simon from Budapest, Hungary and since I can remember, the world of technology has always appealed to me.
                    I was but only thirteen years old when it all began. Slowly but surely I delved into
                    this fascinating thing we call programming. And so my journey began...
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was born in the heart of Transylvania, Cluj-Napoca on 17'th of October 1992.
                    If memory serves me right, I had a pretty descent childhood thanks to my family and close relatives.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One thing I do remember very clearly, and am thankful for until this very day: cartoons.
                    I remember watching a lot of cartoons, which were thankfully never dubbed, courtesy of the Romanian system.

                    And that's where English came into the picture.
