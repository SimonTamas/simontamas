                    <h3>Objective</h3>
                    <p>
                        My objective will always be quality, well written code for readability and all around performance.
                        <br/>
                        Working in a modern environment surrounded by friendly people. Learning new things and sharing knowledge.

                    <h3>How do I have fun?</h3>

                    <ul class="list-check">
                        <li>Full-stack development of cross-browser websites. I receive the design in Photoshop or Illustrator and do the building and backend myself, paying attention to performance and aesthetics at the same time. I comment and document my code in English. My approach to quality (code readability, clean encapsulation, modular development) and performance (caching, compression, lazy loading, minifying, SQL optimizations) paid of several times, in cases where websites received an unplanned amount of traffic or a project hand-off was made to other colleagues. Managers, clients and coworkers were all pleased.
                        </li>
                        <li>Updating websites through staging servers using version control systems. When the client requests a modification or a new feature I work on a copy of the website on a staging server. With the help of Git I keep track of changes made and roll out the working update in a breeze.</li>
                        <li>Planning and scheduling projects for optimal test/release date. Before the start of any project I would sit down with our project manager and talk everything through, afterward subsequently giving him a precise estimate of  what I will be doing and the deadline. Through this process I manage to deliver my projects in optimal time. For project managemnt I use Trello through which leaders and myself can keep track of the progress made. </li>
                        <li>Design and development of modern HTML5 and Flash ads. Given the graphics, storyboard and ad-system specifications I use modern techniques (font subsetting, asset compression, JS library optimization, minification) to deliver a small but visually good looking ad in a short amount of time.</li>
                        <li>Planning, design and development of cross-platform games using Unity or HTML5 game framework: Phaser. I receive animation assets only from Design and from then on I carry the project until the end. Planning to Scheduling, Level and Game design, Prototyping, Development and Alpha/Beta/Release are the processes I manage and deliver.</li>
                        <li>Working on projects with short deadlines. I am fully flexible and enjoy challenges. Strong analytical and problem solving skills enable me to propose multiple viable solutions and if needed, evaluate the best alternative or least problematic compromise.</li>
                        <li>Building of XHTML marketing campaign emails. I receive the design in Photoshop and build the email template which I test through Litmus for complete app and device compatibility. I also had experience with building responsive email templates for use in Mailchimp.</li>
